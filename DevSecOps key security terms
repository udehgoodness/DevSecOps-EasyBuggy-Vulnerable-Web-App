1. SAST (Static Application Security Testing):
   - White box testing analyzing source code.
   - Can be manual or automated using tools like Fortify, Veracode, SonarQube.

2. SCA (Software Composition Analysis):
   - Identifies third-party libraries in source code, along with license and security issues.
   - Tools like Snyk automate SCA.

3. DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing):
   - Black-box testing for web and mobile apps.
   - Automated tools like OWASP ZAP, Veracode, Web Inspect are used.

4. IAST (Interactive Application Security Testing):
   - Blend of SAST and DAST, focusing on specific workflows.
   - Aims to overcome limitations of SAST and DAST.

5. IAC (Infrastructure as Code):
   - Creating infrastructure using code files.
   - Examples: CloudFormation templates for AWS, Terraform for Azure and AWS.
   - Security issues in these files termed as IAC security testing.

6. API Security:
   - Identifies security issues within APIs.
   - Essential for securing microservices, which are subsets of APIs.
   - E.g., a user registration API may have microservices for user management tasks.
